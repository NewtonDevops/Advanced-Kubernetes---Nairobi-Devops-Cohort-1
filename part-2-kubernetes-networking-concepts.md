## üß† Part 2: Kubernetes Networking Concepts

Kubernetes networking is built on a few core concepts that ensure connectivity and scalability across distributed workloads. Here's what you need to know before working with networking in the cluster:

### üß± Pods
- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- One or more containers sharing the same network namespace
- All containers in a Pod communicate via `localhost`

### üåç Services
- Abstract layer to expose a group of Pods
- Provide a stable DNS name and internal IP
- Handles load balancing within the group of Pods

Types of Services:
- `ClusterIP`: Accessible only within the cluster
- `NodePort`: Exposes service on each node at a static port
- `LoadBalancer`: Creates an external IP (cloud)
- `Headless`: No ClusterIP, direct Pod DNS resolution

### üîê NetworkPolicy
- Used to control traffic between Pods
- Default: all Pods can talk to each other
- Once a policy exists, only allowed traffic is permitted
- Useful for Zero Trust security model

### üß© CNI (Container Network Interface)
- A plugin system for pod networking
- Assigns IP addresses to Pods
- Sets up routes, interfaces, and enforces policies

Popular CNIs:
- Calico
- Flannel
- Cilium
- Weave

### üîÑ How It All Works Together
1. Kubernetes schedules a Pod
2. CNI assigns a unique IP
3. A Service provides access to the Pod
4. NetworkPolicies define who can access the Pod
5. DNS and routing ensure packets arrive properly

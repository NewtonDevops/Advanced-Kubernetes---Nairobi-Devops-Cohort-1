# ðŸ§­ Advanced Kubernetes Networking Lab

Welcome to the **Advanced Kubernetes Networking Lab**.  
This guide walks you through deploying and securing multiâ€‘tier applications while deepâ€‘diving into realâ€‘world **Kubernetes networking** tools and concepts.

## ðŸŒŸ Kubernetes Basics â€” Quick Recap

Before we jump into advanced networking, hereâ€™s a 60â€‘second refresher on the core building blocks youâ€™ll be working with:

| Building Block | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Cluster** | The entire Kubernetes controlâ€‘plane + worker nodes | Runs and manages all workloads |
| **Node** | A single VM/host inside the cluster | Provides CPU / memory where Pods run |
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit that wraps oneÂ orÂ more containers sharing the same network namespace | Gets its **own IP** and is the primary target selected by Services |
| **Deployment** | Declarative controller that ensures the desired number of Pod replicas | Handles rolling updates & selfâ€‘healing |
| **Service** | Stable virtual IP + DNS name that loadâ€‘balances traffic to a set of Pods | Decouples clients from changing Pod IPs |
| **Ingress** | L7 HTTP/HTTPS router that brings external traffic into Services | Single entry point with path / hostâ€‘based routing |
| **NetworkPolicy** | Firewall rules for Podâ€‘toâ€‘Pod (and Podâ€‘toâ€‘world) traffic | Enables zeroâ€‘trust microâ€‘segmentation |
| **CNI Plugin** | Lowâ€‘level network provider that gives Pods IPs & enforces policies | Under the hood wiring for all traffic |

    User -- HTTP/HTTPS --> Ingress[Ingress Controller]
    Ingress -- routes --> svcFrontend[Service: frontend]
    svcFrontend -- selects --> podFront1[(Pod)]
    svcFrontend -- selects --> podFront2[(Pod)]
    podFront1 -- REST --> svcBackend[Service: backend]
    podFront2 -- REST --> svcBackend
    svcBackend -- selects --> podBack1[(Pod)]
    svcBackend -- selects --> podBack2[(Pod)]

    class svcFrontend,svcBackend svc;
    class podFront1,podFront2,podBack1,podBack2 pod;
```

*Legend*: External traffic enters through **Ingress**, reaches a **Service** which loadâ€‘balances to healthy **Pods**.  Internal calls cascade through additional Services.  **NetworkPolicies** (not shown) restrict who can talk to whom, and the **CNI plugin** wires the packets.

# üß≠ Advanced Kubernetes Networking Lab

Welcome to the **Advanced Kubernetes Networking Lab**.  
This guide walks you through deploying and securing multi‚Äëtier applications while deep‚Äëdiving into real‚Äëworld **Kubernetes networking** tools and concepts.

## üåü Kubernetes Basics ‚Äî Quick Recap

Before we jump into advanced networking, here‚Äôs a 60‚Äësecond refresher on the core building blocks you‚Äôll be working with:

| Building Block | What It Is | Why It Matters |
|----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Cluster** | The entire Kubernetes control‚Äëplane + worker nodes | Runs and manages all workloads |
| **Node** | A single VM/host inside the cluster | Provides CPU / memory where Pods run |
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit that wraps one¬†or¬†more containers sharing the same network namespace | Gets its **own IP** and is the primary target selected by Services |
| **Deployment** | Declarative controller that ensures the desired number of Pod replicas | Handles rolling updates & self‚Äëhealing |
| **Service** | Stable virtual IP + DNS name that load‚Äëbalances traffic to a set of Pods | Decouples clients from changing Pod IPs |
| **Ingress** | L7 HTTP/HTTPS router that brings external traffic into Services | Single entry point with path / host‚Äëbased routing |
| **NetworkPolicy** | Firewall rules for Pod‚Äëto‚ÄëPod (and Pod‚Äëto‚Äëworld) traffic | Enables zero‚Äëtrust micro‚Äësegmentation |
| **CNI Plugin** | Low‚Äëlevel network provider that gives Pods IPs & enforces policies | Under the hood wiring for all traffic |

**Summary of Components:**

### üß± Control Plane
The **Kubernetes control plane** is the brain of the cluster. It manages the lifecycle of applications, scheduling, scaling, networking, and maintaining the desired state.

- **API Server**: The front-end to the control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and handles all internal and external communication with the cluster.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource requirements and availability.
- **Controller Manager**: Reconciles the cluster‚Äôs actual state with the desired state (e.g., rescheduling a failed Pod).
- **etcd**: A consistent and highly available key-value store used to persist all cluster configuration and state.

All communication flows through the API Server, which acts as the central hub.

### üñ•Ô∏è Virtualization Layer
The **Virtualization Layer** represents the infrastructure that runs the Kubernetes nodes. These can be:

- Virtual Machines (e.g., using Docker Desktop, VirtualBox, or a cloud provider like AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Bare-metal servers (in on-premise data centers)

Each VM/host runs one or more **Kubernetes nodes**.

- **VM / Linux Host**: The physical or virtual machines running your cluster. These form the base layer of the infrastructure (often managed by cloud providers or local virtualization like Docker Desktop).

- **Kubernetes Node**: A worker machine (VM or physical) that runs Pods. Each node runs:
  - `kubelet`: an agent that communicates with the Kubernetes control plane and ensures containers are running.
  - `kube-proxy`: a network proxy that maintains network rules for Pod communication and implements Kubernetes Services networking.

- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. Each pod holds one or more containers that share the same network namespace. They are ephemeral and scheduled by controllers.

- **API Server**: The front-end of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and is the main interface for all cluster operations.

- **Controller Manager**: Handles background tasks such as managing node status, ensuring desired state for Deployments, and managing endpoints.

- **Scheduler**: Assigns newly created Pods to Nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and availability.

- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster data. It acts as the single source of truth for the cluster state.

All components communicate via the API Server. Nodes do not communicate directly with `etcd`.

Pods are deployed through declarative resources (like Deployments), and the control plane ensures their desired state is maintained.
